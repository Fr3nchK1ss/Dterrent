# Post Mortem

Dterrent code compiles with dmd v2.096.0 and a basic engine frame exists. However, there is some work left to display a scene with a model / light.

The original Yage engine was quite experimental with demos only. Porting to D2 / gl3n is a pain. The graphics were based on first gen OpenGL and working on the graphics means working on an outdated stack.

### TODO
See Yage3d/ARCHI/general_view.png, the updated modules are marked in green. Interesting for learning game dev / Dlang.
